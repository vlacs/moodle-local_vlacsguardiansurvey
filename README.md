This plugin is used to receive a web service call from VLA Moodle site.
It creates a new Guardian exit survey and request guardian to answer the survey.
It also display the list of the guardian surveys.

Note that when we speak about "survey" we are using the VLACS term.
The VLACS survey is using the Moodle Feedback module, not the Moodle Survey module.
